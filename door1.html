  <p>
    After entering door number one, you hear it slam behind you and realize
    that theres no going back from here. this room is different from the cave
    entrance that you left behind. its lit by torches and has water running down
    the walls into crevices in the ground. you look around some more and see a
    crawl space in one corner of the room. in the opposite corner, you see a long
    passageway, where the light seems to disappear into darkness...
