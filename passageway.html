  <header>Through the passageway</header>
  <p>
    You head into the passageway, leading into complete darkness. you begin grasping
    at the walls on either side of you to guide your way along this cold and creepy
    passageway....you've fallen through a false floor into a room about the size of
    your body...feeling around you find a knob and turn. the knob was connected to a
    door that opens as you push. you are blinded by sunlight and find yourself on a
    cliff, with no way but down. as you look around you can see a parachute and a rope
    leading down the cliff...you dont know if you can trust the parachute and at the
    same time, you dont know if the rope will hold...
