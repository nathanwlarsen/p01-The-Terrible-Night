  <p>
    You've decided that you don't want to risk it...so you turn yourself around
    and start swimming back...back to the opening...back to fresh air. the underwater
    cave looks different than when you were swimming the other way, other openings
    that you hadn't seen before. you've gotten yourself all turned around and you
    notice four other openings that you hadn't noticed before....air is running out.
    you feel very light headed as you grasp for rock to pull yourself along...you don't
    know if you can make it...you were right...your vision fades to black as you suffocate.
