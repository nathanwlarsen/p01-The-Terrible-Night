  <p>
    Your air is running out but you've stuck to the decision to keep going...never
    give up! you don't know where on earth you may be headed, all you know is that
    you want to get out of the water to fresh air. as soon as you don't think you can
    hold your breath any longer, the underwater tunnel opens up to an even larger
    body of water. you swim the fastest you've ever swam in your life...to the surface...
    that is your only focus. as you emerge from the water, you find yourself in the
    middle of a lake! you've made it out of the cave!
