  <p>
    You decide to take the rope down. You feel confident as the parachute could be
    who knows how old and there was definitely no chance to turn back. You check to
    make sure the rope is anchored well and begin your descent. About halfway down,
    you are glad you made this decision and are ready to get back home to dinner. the
    next thing that happened was the last thing you expected...the rock that you have
    your foot planted on gives way and you smack into the side of the cliff. You lose
    grip of the rope and your stomache sinks as you begin to fall to your certain death...
