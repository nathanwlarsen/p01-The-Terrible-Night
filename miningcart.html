  <p>
    You hop into the mining cart and all of a sudden it starts moving as if
    it knew that you had jumped in. it starts building up speed and you start to
    feel cold air rush past your face. sparks are flying off the rails behind
    you, lighting up the narrow tunnel. you see the cart coming to a lit opening
    and before you know it, the cart has flown off of the rails and you fly through
    the air and into a body of clear water. when you swim out of the water, you see
    that its a dead end!
