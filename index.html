  <p>
    Its a dark night and the moon is full, giving light to some of the
    darkest parts of the hole that you have woken up in. You get up and look
    around but your eyes have yet to adjust to the darkness. you squint your
    eyes and can see the entrance to the hole about 50 feet above your head.
    The walls seem too steep to climb...and as you look more, you notice that
    it was not a hole at all but a cave, containing two unlabeled doors.
    From what you can see, your choices dont seem very different,
    its up to chance now...
