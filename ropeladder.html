  <header>Up the rope ladder</header>
  <p>
    You've reached the top of the rope ladder, fairly tired. you must have
    climbed at least 50 feet of ladder, and ran into several spiders along the
    way. youve entered through the floor of an even smaller room as the previous.
    you can barely see in this room, with the exception of some light coming
    through a tight crevice in the wall, too tight to fit through unfortunately.
    With this light, you can see that the rope ladder keeps going even further
    up and that there is a metal door on the other side of the room...
