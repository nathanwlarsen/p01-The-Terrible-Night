    You decide to go prone on the ground and squeeze your way through the
    crawlspace. one arm in front of the other, pushing your way through the
    darkness...and as soon as you think it isn't going to lead anywhere, you come
    into an opening. there's a body of water against the far wall of the opening
    and to the right you see a metal door...
