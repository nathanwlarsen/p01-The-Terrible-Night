  <p>
    You choose to take the parachute as you are ready to get home and the parachute
    seems like the fastest way down...and you decide that its worth the risk. you leap
    off of the cliff and as soon as you are clear of the cliff side, you pull the cord
    and feel your body yanked as the parachute opens. a smile forms on your face as you
    softly sail to your freedom!
